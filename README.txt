Hi! My name is Austin Jesse. I am a Computer Science undergraduate student going to UA Little Rock.
Due to a switch in laptops in the summer of '21, I lost a lot of my old projects.
As I work on class projects and personal ones I plan to upload them here.
If youre here from my resume, just make sure to ask me about my research, knowledge and so on please.

Again, this GitHub will be updated every time I finish a class and/or a new project.
